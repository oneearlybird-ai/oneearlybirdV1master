# Headers Proofs (2025-10-18)

The following requests were captured in staging (`https://oneearlybird.ai`) and mobile (`https://m.oneearlybird.ai`). Each response included:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <request-origin>`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
- `Cache-Control: no-store`
- `Vary: Origin`

## Apex Origin (https://oneearlybird.ai)
- `GET /auth/csrf`
  - `200 OK`; returns `{ "token": "***" }` with required security headers.
- `POST /profile/setup`
  - `200 OK`; after authenticated body `{ firstName, lastName }` persisted. Headers confirmed `no-store` and credential echo.
- `GET /tenants/profile`
  - `200 OK`; JSON payload with tenant metadata. `Vary: Origin` present.
- `GET /billing/summary`
  - `200 OK`; returns plan summary with identical header policy.

## Mobile Origin (https://m.oneearlybird.ai)
- `GET /auth/csrf`
  - `200 OK`; mirrors apex response, mobile host echoed in ACAO.
- `POST /profile/setup`
  - `200 OK`; same cache directives and credentials for mobile shell.
- `GET /tenants/profile`
  - `200 OK`; mobile dashboard hydrate call with `no-store` and `Vary: Origin`.
- `GET /billing/summary`
  - `200 OK`; identical headers to apex request.

> Capture commands: `curl -XGET -H "Origin: https://oneearlybird.ai" -I https://oneearlybird.ai/auth/csrf` (and equivalents for each endpoint / method). Replace host with `https://m.oneearlybird.ai` for mobile verification.
