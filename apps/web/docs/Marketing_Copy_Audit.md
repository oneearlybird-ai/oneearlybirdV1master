# Marketing Copy Audit

| Route | Copy Updated to EarlyBird | Structure Preserved | Notes |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `/` (desktop) | ✅ Hero, benefits, steps, testimonials, CTA, pricing teaser updated with EarlyBird positioning. | ✅ Card grids, marquee, reveal animations unchanged. | `AuthModalTriggerButton` + `LogoBadge` untouched. |
| `/preview` | ✅ Mirrored copy aligned with home hero/CTA/testimonials. | ✅ Preview layout and gradient banner intact. | Pricing teaser uses same plan labels. |
| `/pricing` | ✅ Tier blurbs + FAQ refreshed (carrier ownership, trial rollover, usage billing). | ✅ `PLAN_DEFINITIONS` left as-is; only JSX text touched. | Tooltip hints preserved. |
| `/m` | ✅ Mobile hero & step cards reflect EarlyBird workflows. | ✅ Mobile card structure + safe-area padding maintained. | CTA destinations unchanged. |
| `/m/pricing` | ✅ Plan blurbs/features align with updated desktop copy. | ✅ Only text within `MobileCardContent` edited. | CTA remains `/m/dashboard/billing`. |
| `/docs` | ⚙️ Already EarlyBird; no changes required. | ✅ | References managed telephony + security guardrails. |
| `/support` & `/support/porting` | ✅ Copy references EarlyBird support emails + LOA steps. | ✅ Layout left untouched. | No new assets. |
| `/changelog` | ✅ Entries reference EarlyBird releases. | ✅ | No edits needed. |
| `/status` | ✅ Messaging matches EarlyBird monitoring/security stance. | ✅ | No changes needed. |

## Additional Checks
- Searched for legacy template references; none remain in copy or component names.
- CTA link set (hero, pricing, nav, footer) matches EarlyBird marketing targets.
- Plan teaser labels stay in sync with `PLAN_DEFINITIONS` (`Starter`, `Professional`, `Growth`, `Enterprise`).
